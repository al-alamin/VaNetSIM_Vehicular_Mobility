# VaNetSIM Vehicular Mobility
This repo contains code for my undergraduate thesis title 'Simulation Study of Vehicular Mobility in City Streets'

## Overview:
Performance evaluation of vehicular network protocols require knowledge of different stochastic properties of the mobility model used in the evaluation. In this thesis work, the stochastic properties of vehicular mobility models in city has been modified and validated by popular simulator VANETSim which run simulation on real street map data. The developed model can be used as a generic framework for comprehensive analysis of other mobility models.
